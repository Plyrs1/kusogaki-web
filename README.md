This is the home of Kusogaki Crew. I joined the crew on January 11th, 2023

## Developing

Using Node.js v18.13.0 and Yarn 1.22.19

```bash
# install packages
yarn

# start dev server
yarn dev

# tidy up
yarn lint
```

## Building

To generate static files :

```bash
yarn build
```

The motivation behind this is to learn frontend dev, also CI/CD in Github. If you want to help me fix my spaghetti code, please kindly send PR!
